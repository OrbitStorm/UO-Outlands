HOW TO USE THESE FILES
by Jewele

The UOMapper.zip contains the \Icons and \Markers files in it. You can download the .zip as an alternative to downloading the entire repo to get these files.

1. Stop Ultima Mapper if it is running
2. Extract the .zip into your UO Mapper resources folder, which will be :
   C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\Ultima Mapper.
3. Restart Ultima Mapper
4. Select - Markers - you will now see the new marker options.
5. Guild houses is "Guild Houses"

That's it.
