/////////////////////////////////////////////
// UO Steam Stealth+Camping Training Macro
// for Outlands
//
// A lot of people don't know that moving while
// stealthed actually passively raises it! Hence
// the macro will walk you back and forth a bit
// to raise, once hidden.
//
// Position yourself against a wall North and run.
//
// One stealth starts increasing you want to equip armor
// - more and more as the skill increases.
// 65 – 95 Leather/Studded suit pieces
// 95 – 100  Full Studded Leather Suit + Close Helm
//
// For Camping, its just easier to spam the skill and let the 
// game give messages rather than parse log to detect if you 
// were successful.
