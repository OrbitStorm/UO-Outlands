 This macro sets out to automate the task of leveling taming

 Things required?
 a tank pet (I recommend a Rock Guar), Veterinary (Can be dropped once GM Taming)a LOT of bandages.

 What does it do?
 It will look for certain graphics and tame them, once tamed it will rename them to 'killme' and proceed to kill the pet
 Dex skills are not required to kill the tame, but helps. If you are going for a magery build - I suggest having one or two pets
 to assist in killing the tamed pet. Ensure your kill pets + tank pet + tamed pet do not exceed the follower count, otherwise
 they will not obey your commands to kill the freshly tamed pet.

 How do I use it?
 This works very well for single spawns of tames, without any other additional creatures to potentially aggro you
 This is achieved by setting your tank pet in a position where any spawned monsters will be closer to your pet than you.
 Command it to stop, and stand one tile behind/diagonal to it, to ensure that anything that spawns will target your pet
 Where do you suggest I tame these?
 Low traffic areas are best, however in some cases such as Molten Mongbats and Bullvores, their spawns are much easier in dungeons to deal with

 Do I have to tame these creatures?
 No. Feel free to change any graphics to whatever you prefer. I have leveled three tamers with this macro, and have merely placed suggestions to help those who might need it. :)

 Why do Sand Crabs have a very large skill gain window listed?
 Due to these being a very passive creature, and in some very out of the way areas, I find these are worth macroing on over a couple of days. This will GM anat/tactics/weaponskill very quickly, as taming a creature gives Active Skill Bonus. Feel free to ignore this suggestion if you want to go slightly faster.

 Why does the bandage not complete on my tank pet?
 The script was written with 100 Dex in mind, you will need to edit the heal portions with a pause which is long enough for your bandage timer.

 Where should I tame?
 From my own experience (1x 120 Tamer and 2x GM Tamer) follow the below guide; I try to find isolated spawns with fairly set spawn tiles

Shallow Water (50.0 - 52.5) - Find a quiet isolated spawn on the coast, plenty to choose from
Sand Crab (55.0 - 70.0) - East of Prevalia Zoo, there's a single spawn - I camp this for a couple of days to 70 (this also gets dex skills to GM in this time)
Scarab (70.0 - 72.5) - Oasis south of Ossuary
Drake Whelp (75.0 - 77.5) - I find the north corner as soon as you get into level2 is quietest, your pet will need to tank the drake also
Bullvore (80.0 - 82.5) - Inferno has a couple of isolated spawns, much easier to macro than in the desert.
Drake (85.0 - 87.5) - Same spot as drake whelps
Husk Crab (90.0 - 92.5) - South of Prevalia at the ship wreck. I tend to go to the further spawns as people don't usually venture that far in
Molten Mongbat (95.0 - 97.5) Inferno, Level 2 has a fairly quiet spawn just as you enter. I find reds ignore you if you're naked (most of the time)
Snow Drift (100.0 - 102.5) - Ice Fortress, some fairly decent isolated spawns. 
Earth Drake (105.0 - 107.5) - Back side of Mount Petram Level 3.
Aegis Minion (110.0 - 112.5) - there's a room South West with an aegis imp, slime and minion. Afk in a corner and let your pet offtank everything.
Earth Dragon (115.0 - 117.5) - Same spot as drakes, back of petram
