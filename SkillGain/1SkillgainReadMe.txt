All of these macros are set in hopes of taking you from 50 to 120 skill without editing the macro. Have a secure container within 2 tiles that you put all your tools and resources into. I didn't setup use of commodity deeds in any of these macros because to my knowledge secure containers don't have weight limits. If you need 300k of a resource you can just make 5 stacks.

IF YOU AREN'T SCROLLED TO 120 YOU NEED TO EDIT THE MACROS! A portion near the top will say "while skill BLAHBLAH < 120" change 120 to 100, or whatever your max is. If you don't then it will keep eating resources despite the fact that you can't gain.

You can set a secure in your bank, but you would have to have your bank open the entire time the macro is running.

***********50to120Tailor***********
50-120 can be attained unattended if stash is has enough saws/boards. 

***********50to120Cartog***********
50-120 can be attained unattended if stash is has enough pens/maps. 
Self explanatory and simple but requires a trash can within 2 tiles as well. There are some delays when you have to wait for the trash can to empty, but I didn't want to add/remove trash cans so I just added a wait timer.

***********50to120Cooking***********
Some human intervention required
Does not use a secure since you can throw over 3000 raws into your pack. If you're near an oven make sure you don't have kindling in your pack, as it will use them. Also do not have a part of the macro to dispose of cooked food, I think if you're overloaded it just drops cooked food to the floor.

50-120 can be attained unattended if stash is has enough kits/leather.

GM-120 can be attained unattended if stash has enough pens/cloth/scrolls

***********Poisoning***********
Much human intervention required
The macro isn't smart enough to differentiate between one level of poison keg vs the other, so the keg that is in your pack must be chosen by you. You also need to restock greater cure pots manually. I had originally set this up with bandages but curing sucks on this shard so I kept dying while macroing.
