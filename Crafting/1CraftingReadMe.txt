*MakeLastUniversal*
Allows you to change 3 sets of graphics (tool, resource, and item you're making) very easily. After you've edited the macro you make the item once, then the macro continues to make and recycle all of the item you're making. Idea is if you're trying to gain a skill, or do a society job, you can just hit play and let it take care of the rest


*MakeLastEXPShelf*
Operates similarly to MakeLastUniversal in that you only need to edit 3 things and it goes from there. The reason to use this macro is that you're trying to keep exceptionals and recycle regulars. The best part of this macro is if you select a shelf it will automatically restock it for you. The worst part of this macro is it'll keep running until you've run out of tools, resources, or just hit stop. That means keep an eye on it to make sure you don't make too many exceptionals.
