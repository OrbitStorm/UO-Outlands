***********AutoVet***********
Will automatically vet whichever pet is lowest % hp, but if that pet is more than 1 tile away it'll send an error message instead. You can add permanent pets lower in the macro so you don't have to target them each time you start your client. Does not heal until 19% HP is gone from pet, change this by looking for if @diffhits 'HealIt[0]' > 19

***********AutoVetHeal***********
Same as above but it bandages you too. You heal when more than 15% damage is done, change if diffhits > 15 and skill healing > 29

***********AutoVetSingle***********
Heals only a single pet, good to switch to when you want to focus on tank pet and other pets are dead

***********AutoXPHeal***********
Pet leveler, still in beta stage. Add things to the kill list. It will find things in the list and attack them, then call out all guard. If a pet is low on hp it brings it back to you, vets, then sends it out to guard again.

***********HerdAttackKill***********
Pretty self explanatory, great for archer tamers. At the bottom edit out // to have it automatically goto your autovet macro.

***********Tame50to70***********
Goto the frog room in shelter and hit run, enjoy 70 taming! I just let this one run overnight. Some people can be jerks and drag Orcs onto you. If you have healing it will bandage you too.

***********Tame50to120***********
Similar to above, but with more checks. You must use a tank pet and must make sure it is positioned between yourself and spawns. It tries to kill your tamed pets but sometimes a new one spawns before it's done, so keep an eye on this one. I've been able to let it run overnight before, but I'm not sure if it would work with dragons and other harder mobs. Most notes you need are in the macro.

***********TameTarget***********
Brings up target cursor, once you target an animal it tries to tame until successful. Good for mobs that don't aggro.

***********TameTargetFollow***********
Same as above except it follows the creature

***********TameTargetVetHeal***********
Same as TameTarget but it does vet on your tank pet. Will bandage yourself if you have healing.
