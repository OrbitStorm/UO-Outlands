As of now they are player steered macros, more of an assistant. They swing tools, replace broken tools, pause for macro checks, alert for PK's (uses tracking if your skill is above 34), and while mining loads up a pack animal

If your pack animal is far enough away from you on the Z axis (you are a tile away, but up several steps) it won't be able to read the pack contents and will drop ore on the floor. It only puts iron ore in the pack animal, so there is a possibility of you filling up from colored ore before the pack animal hits 2000 stones.
