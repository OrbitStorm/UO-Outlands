As of now they are player steered macros, more of an assistant. They swing tools, replace broken tools, pause for macro checks, alert for PK's (uses tracking if your skill is above 34), and while mining loads up a pack animal

Moves around in a circle-ish, otherwise same as lumberjack manual

***********LumberjackManual***********
Simple assistant, no edits needed. Uses tracking and scans for red/crim around you. If a hatchet breaks it equips another from your pack. Pauses and alerts when a macrocheck occurs. Pauses for world saves. You can edit around line 90-110 to change the alert headmsg to play a recall macro for escaping.


***********MiningManual***********
Simple assistant, no edits needed. Uses tracking and scans for red/crim around you. If a pickaxe breaks it equips another from your pack. Pauses and alerts when a macrocheck occurs. Pauses for world saves. You can edit around line 100-120 to change the alert headmsg to play a recall macro for escaping. Moves 10 iron ore when you're within 128 stones of being full.

*If your pack animal is far enough away from you on the Z axis (you are a tile away, but up or down several steps) it won't be able to read the pack contents and will drop ore on the floor. It only puts iron ore in the pack animal, so there is a possibility of you filling up from colored ore before the pack animal hits 2000 stones. Pack animal should only ever have iron ore in it, anything else will break macro.*

***********MiningManualMultiPack***********
Same as above but now you can select up to 5 pack animals. I'd suggest selecting 4, then keeping colored ore in the 5th.
